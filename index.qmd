1. Intialization and setup
  Why R? - discuss how Python is growing faster and has more resources, but discuss FDA
      - plug book
      - stats audience
      - GGIR
  - Startup script
  - RStudio 
  - Borrow from intro to R
    - read.gt3x, agcounts, actilifecounts, etc. GGIR
    - lubridate, tidyverse
    - ADVANCED - reticulate, walking, stepcount, SummarizedActigraphy
2. The data
  - What questions have been answered by this data
      - activity, sleep, real-world estimates
  - Sensors, placement - 5 minutes
  - Sample rate, location, 
  - Walk through previous NHANES device
      - what is GT3X
      - getting attributes/header information
    - Ax3 (cwa), GGIRread
      - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIRread/index.html
    - Commercial grade stuff
      - ActiLife, ActiGraph, ActiGraphConnect
      - https://www.actigraphcorp.com/
    - Why start with raw data (algo changes - on device and out in wild, SI units, really the "true" data)
    - Reading in ActiGraph CSVs
3. Outline slide
  - read in data
  - reasmple data
  - plot data
  - Activity Counts/MIMS/AI/ENMO
  - wear/nonwear estimation
  - derive steps
  - Aggregate into "average day"
  - Disucssion of inclusion criteria/missingness
4. Read in the data
  - what is the data
  - idle sleep mode - LOCF
  - Calibration 
  - Vector Norm
  - Dealing with Time
  - Dealing with Time Zones
5. MVPA and Thresholds

10. wristpy and python stuff
