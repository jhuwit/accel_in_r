Despite the widespread use in research, the development of software to explore the data collected from these devices has been limited. We present acc, a comprehensive, free, and open-source R package to provide a seamless environment for exploring accelerometer data (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/acc). In this article, we demonstrate the software for processing, visualizing, and analyzing accelerometer data using real and simulated datasets.}
