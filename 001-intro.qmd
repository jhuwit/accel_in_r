## What is Accelerometer Data?

- **Sensor that measures acceleration** in 3D space
  - X-axis: Left-Right
  - Y-axis: Up-Down
  - Z-axis: Forward-Backward
- Typically measured in **g-forces (g)** or **m/sÂ²**
- Sampled at regular time intervals (e.g., 30Hz, 100Hz)

---

## How Does It Work?

1. Small **MEMS accelerometer** inside a wearable device
2. Measures acceleration by detecting **motion and gravitational forces**
3. Outputs time-series data: raw acceleration signals

## Wrist-Worn vs. Hip-Worn Accelerometers

| Feature       | Wrist-Worn Devices  | Hip-Worn Devices  |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Placement    | Worn on wrist    | Attached to belt |
| Compliance   | Higher           | Lower           |
| Activity Types | Captures arm movements | Better for whole-body movement |
| Sleep Analysis | Better for sleep patterns | Less accurate |

---

## Common Data Formats

- **Raw Accelerometer Data** (high-resolution time-series data)
- **Activity Counts** (aggregated over time windows)
- **Wear Time Detection** (non-wear vs. wear periods)
- **Energy Expenditure Estimation** (calories burned estimation)

---

## Applications in Health Research

- **Physical Activity Measurement**
  - Quantifies sedentary behavior, light, moderate, and vigorous activity
- **Sleep Monitoring**
  - Detects sleep patterns, wake episodes
- **Fall Detection & Mobility Analysis**
  - Identifies changes in gait and risk of falls
- **Chronic Disease Monitoring**
  - Links between movement patterns and cardiometabolic diseases

---

## Example Studies

- **NHANES Accelerometry (CDC)**
  - Large-scale population studies using wrist-worn devices
- **UK Biobank Wearable Data**
  - Over 100,000 participants with 7-day wrist accelerometer recordings

---

## Summary

- **Accelerometers measure movement** in three axes
- **Wrist-worn vs. hip-worn** sensors have different strengths
- **Common applications** include physical activity, sleep monitoring, and disease tracking
- **Key public datasets** provide rich sources for research
